<p>Delicious Handrawn is a font inspired by the Agung Rohmat's handwriting. He started to draw all the glyphs on his Ipad, using the Procreate app. The challenge was to find the drawing that work for him, because he felt that his handwriting was not neat. So it took a lot of testing before he found the perfect design.</p>
